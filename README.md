# MSMPLOTTER Library V1.0.0 for Arduino
## Written by: MAINAK MONDAL.
Plotting on Serial Monitor not in Serial Plotter in Arduino Ide.
We can check Serial Communication in Arduino IDE using Serial Monitor and Serial Plotter.
Serial PLotter is specifiacaly introdced for plotting curves and live data analysis with graph.
This library can plot graph of some sequential values.Timestump will be taken automatically.
# Data Analysis
This is library can process maximum 12 bit Resolution mean lesser than 4096.
Also the variables are unsigned.
